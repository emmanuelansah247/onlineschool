                    The PhD in Political Science at the BIIM School of Law International Relations draws
                    from the breadth and depth of intellectual resources across BIIM, providing our
                    students with rigorous cross-disciplinary training, both substantively and
                    methodologically. They work closely with prominent scholars whose cutting-edge
                    research activities and professional engagements play key roles in national and
                    global policy development.

                    Our students organize their programs around a choice of two fields of study. In their
                    primary field, they specialize in African, European, American or comparative politics.
                    Their secondary field can be chosen either from within the School of Law and
                    International Relations—public policy or public administration, for example—or from a
                    department within another school at BIIM that grants doctoral degrees. Regardless of
                    their selected fields, students may enroll in courses from any department within the
                    School of Law and International Relations.
