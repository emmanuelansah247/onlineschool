                    A car’s electrical system is a bit like your body’s circulatory system in that it has a battery (the heart) from which 
                    electricity (blood) flows along the wires (the blood vessels) to the parts that require it, before returning to the 
                    battery. In fact, the analogy is closer still when you consider that like blood, the electrical current flows in only 
                    one direction – from the battery, to the part being powered and back to the battery through the car’s metal body. 
                    Not only that, just as blood flows under pressure, so does electricity. The pressure it flows at is measured in 
                    volts and the amount of electricity that is flowing, in amperes, usually shortened to amps, although this figure 
                    is more usually expressed by another measure called watts. As the electricity flows, it encounters resistance when 
                    the wire can conduct less of it (a bit like a narrower blood vessel), an effect that is measured in ohms. If this 
                    resistance is too high (in other words, if the wire is too thin) heat is generated. This happens in a light bulb where 
                    the thin filament cannot conduct the electricity easily and so is turned white hot by it in a gas that won’t cause 
                    it to burn. This course trains Assistants that could set up their own business after achieving a good level of experience 
                    in the industry or  they may choose to work under supervision of Engineers.
