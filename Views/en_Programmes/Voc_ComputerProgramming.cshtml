                    Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer 
                    program to accomplish a specific computing result. Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, 
                    generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation 
                    of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding).
                    This course trains Assistants that could set up their own business after achieving a good level 
                    of experience in the industry 
                    or  they may choose to work under supervision of Engineers.
