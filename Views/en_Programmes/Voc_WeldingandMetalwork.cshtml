                    Metalworking is the process of working with metals to create individual parts, assemblies, or large-scale structures. 
                    The term covers a wide range of work from large ships and bridges to precise engine parts and delicate jewelry. 
                    It therefore includes a correspondingly wide range of skills, processes, and tools. This course trains 
                    Assistants that could set up their own business after achieving a good 
                    level of experience in the industry or  they may choose to work under supervision of Engineers.
