                    Get certified as a Logistics Technician or Certified Logistics Associate! Logistics and 
                    distribution are critical to help products and services reach the end consumer. Learn about 
                    scheduling and planning the movement of goods and services. Logistics operations require well-trained 
                    workers within facilities and warehouses to ensure that the goods are where they should be and that 
                    orders are filled and shipped to match the customersâ€™ orders.
