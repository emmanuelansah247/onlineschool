                    Carpentry is a skilled trade and a craft in which the primary work performed is the cutting, shaping and 
                    installation of building materials during the construction of buildings, ships, timber bridges, concrete 
                    formwork, etc. Carpenters traditionally worked with natural wood and did the rougher work such as framing, 
                    but today many other materials are also used and sometimes the finer trades of cabinetmaking and furniture 
                    building are considered carpentry. This course trains Assistants that could set up their own business after 
                    achieving a good level of experience in the industry or  they may choose to work under supervision of Engineers.
