                    An explosives worker is a highly trained professional who works with volatile substances such as 
                    industrial chemicals, weapons and explosive demolition materials. As the name implies, these individuals 
                    deal frequently with very dangerous substances and must have exceptional powers of concentration to keep 
                    themselves and those around them safe. The mining industry employs explosives workers to set dynamite charges 
                    and expose new mineral veins; law enforcement and military applications for an explosives worker may include 
                    defusing bombs and rigging land mines. Other explosives workers work in construction and demolition, where 
                    they must choose which explosives to use, and where to place them, so that a condemned building collapses safely 
                    and quickly. This course emphasizes on the management of explosive and blasting rocks in the Mining sector.
