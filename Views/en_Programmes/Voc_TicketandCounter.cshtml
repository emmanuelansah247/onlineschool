                    Ticket Agents work on airport counters or other designated sales points that airlines 
                    might have. In general terms, Ticket Agents greet and help customers and passengers with their flight 
                    reservations. They provide information regarding dates, schedules, availability, and prices of flights. 
                    Ticket Agents are expected to sell flights and other products the airline may offer, as well as assist passengers 
                    with inquiries or other requests, such as flight changes or cancellations. This course trains Agents that could 
                    set up their own business after achieving a good level of experience in the industry or  they may choose to work 
                    under supervision of Travel Agency Administrator.
