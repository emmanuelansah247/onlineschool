                    A travel administrator is responsible for researching, arranging and coordinating travel, 
                    transportation and accommodation for employees and clients according to a specific organization's 
                    business and budget needs. Relevant experience in a related field is usually necessary to become a 
                    travel administrator. This course trains Administrators that could set up their own business after 
                    achieving a good level of experience in the industry.
