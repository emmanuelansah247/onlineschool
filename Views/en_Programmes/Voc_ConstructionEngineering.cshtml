                    Construction engineering is a professional discipline that deals with the designing, planning, 
                    construction and management of infrastructures such as roads, tunnels, bridges, airports, railroads, 
                    facilities, buildings, dams, utilities and other projects.
                    Civil engineering is a related field that deals more with the practical aspects of projects. Construction 
                    engineers learn some of the design aspects similar to civil engineers as well as project site management 
                    aspects. This course trains Assistants that could set up their own business after achieving 
                    a good level of experience in the industry or  they may choose to work under supervision of Engineers.
