                    Industrial automation is the use of control systems, such as computers or robots, and information 
                    technologies for handling different processes and machineries in an industry to replace a human being. 
                    It is the second step beyond mechanization in the scope of industrialization. This course trains Assistants 
                    that could set up their own business after achieving a good level of experience in the industry or  they may 
                    choose to work under supervision of Engineers.
