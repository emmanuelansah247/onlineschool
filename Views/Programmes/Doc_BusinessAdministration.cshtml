                   The DBA program represents an extended academic study into a particular field of
                    knowledge with a clearly defined objective. Students will work closely with their
                    professors who will also provide mentorship to obtain approvals in each step of the
                    doctoral learning process. Those who earn the DBA degree must be able to
                    demonstrate significant intellectual achievement and must contribute to their
                    respective field of investigation via scholarly knowledge. Therefore, candidates of the
                    DBA program should have earned their master’s degree in the same field of study
                    chosen for their doctoral work.
